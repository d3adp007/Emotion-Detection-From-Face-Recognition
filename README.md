# Emotion-Detection-From-Facial-Expressions

# Convolutionnel Neural Networks For Facial Expression Recognition 
****
Emotion detection from facial expression is one of the most active research fields, and plays a huge part in today’s technology. It can be implemented using machine learning algorithms, although these can’t provide  a hundred percent accurate solution since facial expression are not always the same and they depend on the person, the brightness, the position, and so on. This Notebook, presents an implementation of a deep learning algorithm for emotion detection using Convolutional Neural Network after some pre-processing steps to prepare our data uing OpenCV. Our choice of using CNN for this matter is based on the fact that this algorithm performs better than other solutions. Also, to conduct this experiment we have used a dataset which is a mix of other datasets like JAFFE and that was provided by Kaggle in the context of a competition.
